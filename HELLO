Hello Damarindra

I was looking for a way to contact you on your website, but didn't find one, so I thought this would be an interesting way :)

My name is Noam, and I am the CTO of an interesting startup company.
We are making a gaming platform, that will allow players everywhere in the world to play against each other.
As such, part of our work is to create games to be used by the platform.
During our search for games we stumbled upon your Rects project, and liked it.
We were wondering if you would be interested in working remotely with us on building and adjusting Unity games to our platform.
If not, would you be willing to provide support specifically for the Rects project?

I would appreciate if you contact me by email with your thoughts. If you'll find this interesting, we can later arrange a video call.
I'm at noam.s@joongopg.com

Hope to hear from you soon :-)
Noam
